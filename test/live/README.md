# `test/live/` - live-test harness

A live, real-Azure-resource harness used by the `live-test` PR check (see
the [`live-test-actions`](https://github.com/canada-ca-terraform-modules/live-test-actions)
repo and this module's own `.github/workflows/live-test.yml`) to prove that
an open PR doesn't destroy or replace a resource a real consumer already has
running. It is **not** a substitute for the module's mock-based
`tests/*.tftest.hcl` unit tests (fast, free, run on every PR via
`terraform-ci.yml`) - run those first.

## What's here

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `main.tf` | Module block with `source = "../../"` (a relative path, not a pinned `?ref` - "baseline" and "PR" are just two on-disk checkouts of this repo), the `azurerm` provider config, and an empty `backend "local" {}` block (path supplied at `init` time - see below). |
| `test_dependencies.tf` | A dedicated, throwaway resource group this harness owns outright - never a shared/production resource group. Its name is suffixed with `var.pr_number` so concurrently open PRs never collide. |
| `variables.tf` | `env`, `group`, `project` (all default `"livetest"`), `location` (defaults to `canadacentral`), `tags`, `pr_number` (defaults to `"manual"`), and `appServicePlan` (typed `any`, passed straight through to the module - `resource_group` is injected by `main.tf`, not part of the tracked fixture). |
| `config/app_service_plan.tfvars` | One representative real-usage fixture: a Linux `B1` App Service Plan, no `for_each` fan-out. |

No Terragrunt anywhere under this directory - a single harness per repo has
no cross-harness DRY need.

## Running it manually

Requires your own `az login` session against the sandbox subscription.

```bash
cd test/live
terraform init
terraform plan  -var-file=config/app_service_plan.tfvars
terraform apply -var-file=config/app_service_plan.tfvars
```

Confirm only the live-test resource group and `module.app_service_plan` are
planned/applied, then tear it down:

```bash
terraform destroy -var-file=config/app_service_plan.tfvars
```

No `.tfstate` file is ever committed under `test/live/` - every run is
fully ephemeral, whether run by CI or by hand.

## Two-checkout state isolation (baseline vs. PR)

CI proves a PR isn't a breaking change by applying the target branch as a
live baseline, then plan/apply-ing the PR branch's checkout of this same
harness against that same live state - two on-disk checkouts of this repo,
one shared external state file, no state copying between them:

```bash
# Directory A: PR branch checkout, directory B: target branch checkout.
STATE=$RUNNER_TEMP/live-test-<pr-number>.tfstate

# 1. Baseline apply, from B.
cd B/test/live
terraform init -backend-config="path=$STATE"
terraform apply -var-file=config/app_service_plan.tfvars -var="pr_number=<pr-number>"

# 2. PR plan (and, in CI, apply), from A, against the same state file.
cd A/test/live
terraform init -backend-config="path=$STATE"
terraform plan -var-file=config/app_service_plan.tfvars -var="pr_number=<pr-number>"

# 3. Always tear down from A once the run finishes (`if: always()` in CI).
terraform destroy -var-file=config/app_service_plan.tfvars -var="pr_number=<pr-number>"
```

`pr_number` (`TF_VAR_pr_number` in CI, sourced from `github.event.number`)
suffixes every `test_dependencies.tf` resource name, so two concurrently
open PRs against this module - each pointed at their own
`live-test-<pr-number>.tfstate` - never collide on the same sandbox resource
group or App Service Plan name.

To verify this locally without CI: check out this branch into two
directories, run step 1 from one and step 2 from the other against a
shared local state file path, and confirm the plan in step 2 diffs against
the resources step 1 actually created (not an empty/fresh-state plan).
Repeat with two different `pr_number` values pointed at two different state
files and confirm no resource-name collision in the sandbox resource group.
