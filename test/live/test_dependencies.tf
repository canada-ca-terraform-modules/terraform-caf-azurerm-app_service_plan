# a shared RG usually requires elevated, non-sandbox permissions. A dedicated
# throwaway RG here needs only Contributor on the sandbox subscription and
# can never collide with or affect any production resource.

# terraform-caf-azurerm-app_service_plan needs only a resource group - no ASE
# or vnet/subnet dependency is exercised by the tracked fixture.
